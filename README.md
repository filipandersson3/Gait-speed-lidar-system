# Gait speed lidar system
Lidar system for measuring walking speed using a Garmin LIDAR-Lite v3. 

It records distance over time for a person walking in front of a lidar. This data is stored on the device until it gets extracted over USB using a python program.

This repo contains the KiCAD project, code for the microcontroller and python code for data extraction. It also contains measurement data.

This is related to my thesis project, you can find more information [here.](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:umu:diva-240602)
